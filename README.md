# hydrostability-playground

Simulaion of hydrostability of 2D shapes using three methods:
- minimum potential energy
- GZ righting arm
- catastrophe theory (buoyanci loci & their evolutes)

Instances of `Shape` class are defined as an arrangement of instances of the `Triangle` class. Each triangle is defined by the coordinates of its three corners.
